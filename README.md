## Project Description

This project implements the classic game of Hangman in Python. The aim of the project is to provide a fun and interactive way to practice vocabulary and problem-solving skills.

**What it does:**
- The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- The player guesses letters one at a time to try and reveal the word.
- With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn.
- The player wins if they guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
- The player loses if the hangman is fully drawn.

**What I learned:**
- Working with lists, strings, and random number generation in Python.
- Implementing game logic and user interaction.
- Handling user input and validating guesses.
